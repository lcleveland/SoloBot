# SoloBot
A fully modular IRC bot intended for use on Twitch
This is a personal learning project so while usable there may be some issues; just let me know about them and I'll fix them immediately.

I have put my keys into the project property settings and excluded them from git for obvious security reason. Be aware that you will either have to add the settings or change the code to reflect your own keys.
